This template scaffolds a LangChain.js + Next.js starter app. It demonstrates connecting a LangGraph agent to a Next.js project using the Vercel AI SDK to stream tokens to the client.
The agents use [LangGraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/), LangChain's framework for building agentic workflows. They use preconfigured helper functions to minimize boilerplate, but you can replace them with custom graphs as desired.

It's free-tier friendly too! Check out the [bundle size stats below](#-bundle-size).

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
To start with the basic examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key.

Because this app is made to run in serverless Edge functions, make sure you've set the `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` environment variable to `false` to ensure tracing finishes if you are using [LangSmith tracing](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager (e.g. `yarn`).

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/langgraph](http://localhost:3000/langgraph) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/langgraph/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[LangChain Expression Language](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language) to
compose different LangChain.js modules together. You can integrate other retrievers, agents, preconfigured chains, and more too, though keep in mind
`HttpResponseOutputParser` is meant to be used directly with model output.

To learn more about what you can do with LangChain.js, check out the docs here:

## ▲ Deploy on Vercel

When ready, you can deploy your app on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
